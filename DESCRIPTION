Description: Read Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange (SDMX) XML data into R. 
    This the main transmission format used in official statistics. Data can be imported from
    local SDMX-ML files or a SDMX web-service and will be read in 'as is' into a dataframe object.
    The 'RapidXML' C++ library <http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net> is used to parse the XML data.
